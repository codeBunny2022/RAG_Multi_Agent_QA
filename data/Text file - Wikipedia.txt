Text file
A text file (sometimes spelled textfile; an old alternative
name is flat file) is a kind of computer file that is
structured as a sequence of lines of electronic text. A text
file exists stored as data within a computer file system.
In operating systems such as CP/M, where the operating
system does not keep track of the file size in bytes, the
end of a text file is denoted by placing one or more special
characters, known as an end-of-file (EOF) marker, as
padding after the last line in a text file. In modern
operating systems such as DOS, Microsoft Windows and
Unix-like systems, text files do not contain any special
EOF character, because file systems on those operating
systems keep track of the file size in bytes.

Some operating systems, such as Multics, Unix-like
systems, CP/M, DOS, the classic Mac OS, and Windows, store text files as a sequence of bytes, with an endof-line delimiter at the end of each line. Other operating systems, such as OpenVMS and OS/360 and its
successors, have record-oriented filesystems, in which text files are stored as a sequence either of fixedlength records or of variable-length records with a record-length value in the record header.
"Text file" refers to a type of container, while plain text refers to a type of content.
At a generic level of description, there are two kinds of computer files: text files and binary files.[1]

Data storage
Because of their simplicity, text files are commonly used for storage of
information. They avoid some of the problems encountered with other
file formats, such as endianness, padding bytes, or differences in the
number of bytes in a machine word. Further, when data corruption
occurs in a text file, it is often easier to recover and continue processing
the remaining contents. A disadvantage of text files is that they usually
have a low entropy, meaning that the information occupies more storage
than is strictly necessary.
A simple text file may need no additional metadata (other than
knowledge of its character set) to assist the reader in interpretation. A
text file may contain no data at all, which is a case of zero-byte file.

Encoding
The ASCII character set is the most common compatible subset of character sets for English-language text
files, and is generally assumed to be the default file format in many situations. It covers American English,
but for the British pound sign, the euro sign, or characters used outside English, a richer character set must
be used. In many systems, this is chosen based on the default locale setting on the computer it is read on.
Prior to UTF-8, this was traditionally single-byte encodings (such as ISO-8859-1 through ISO-8859-16) for
European languages and wide character encodings for Asian languages.
Because encodings necessarily have only a limited repertoire of characters, often very small, many are only
usable to represent text in a limited subset of human languages. Unicode is an attempt to create a common
standard for representing all known languages, and most known character sets are subsets of the very large
Unicode character set. Although there are multiple character encodings available for Unicode, the most
common is UTF-8, which has the advantage of being backwards-compatible with ASCII; that is, every
ASCII text file is also a UTF-8 text file with identical meaning. UTF-8 also has the advantage that it is easily
auto-detectable. Thus, a common operating mode of UTF-8 capable software, when opening files of
unknown encoding, is to try UTF-8 first and fall back to a locale dependent legacy encoding when it
definitely is not UTF-8.

Formats
On most operating systems, the name text file refers to a file format that allows only plain text content with
very little formatting (e.g., no bold or italic types). Such files can be viewed and edited on text terminals or
in simple text editors. Text files usually have the MIME type text/plain, usually with additional
information indicating an encoding.

Microsoft Windows text files
DOS and Microsoft Windows use a common text file format, with each line of text separated by a twocharacter combination: carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF). It is common for the last line of text not to be
terminated with a CR-LF marker, and many text editors (including Notepad) do not automatically insert one
on the last line.
On Microsoft Windows operating systems, a file is regarded as a text file if the suffix of the name of the file
(the "filename extension") is .txt. However, many other suffixes are used for text files with specific
purposes. For example, source code for computer programs is usually kept in text files that have file name
suffixes indicating the programming language in which the source is written.
Most Microsoft Windows text files use ANSI, OEM, Unicode or UTF-8 encoding. What Microsoft Windows
terminology calls "ANSI encodings" are usually single-byte ISO/IEC 8859 encodings (i.e. ANSI in the
Microsoft Notepad menus is really "System Code Page", non-Unicode, legacy encoding), except for in
locales such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean that require double-byte character sets. ANSI encodings were
traditionally used as default system locales within Microsoft Windows, before the transition to Unicode. By
contrast, OEM encodings, also known as DOS code pages, were defined by IBM for use in the original IBM
PC text mode display system. They typically include graphical and line-drawing characters common in DOS
applications. "Unicode"-encoded Microsoft Windows text files contain text in UTF-16 Unicode
Transformation Format. Such files normally begin with byte order mark (BOM), which communicates the

endianness of the file content. Although UTF-8 does not suffer from endianness problems, many Microsoft
Windows programs (i.e. Notepad) prepend the contents of UTF-8-encoded files with BOM,[2] to
differentiate UTF-8 encoding from other 8-bit encodings.[3]

Unix text files
On Unix-like operating systems, text files format is precisely described: POSIX defines a text file as a file
that contains characters organized into zero or more lines,[4] where lines are sequences of zero or more nonnewline characters plus a terminating newline character,[5] normally LF.
Additionally, POSIX defines a printable file as a text file whose characters are printable or space or
backspace according to regional rules. This excludes most control characters, which are not printable.[6]

Apple Macintosh text files
Prior to the advent of macOS, the classic Mac OS system regarded the content of a file (the data fork) to be a
text file when its resource fork indicated that the type of the file was "TEXT".[7] Lines of classic Mac OS
text files are terminated with CR characters.[8]
Being a Unix-like system, macOS uses Unix format for text files.[8] Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) used for
text files in macOS is "public.plain-text"; additional, more specific UTIs are: "public.utf8-plain-text" for utf8-encoded text, "public.utf16-external-plain-text" and "public.utf16-plain-text" for utf-16-encoded text and
"com.apple.traditional-mac-plain-text" for classic Mac OS text files.[7]

Rendering
When opened by a text editor, human-readable content is presented to the user. This often consists of the
file's plain text visible to the user. Depending on the application, control codes may be rendered either as
literal instructions acted upon by the editor, or as visible escape characters that can be edited as plain text.
Though there may be plain text in a text file, control characters within the file (especially the end-of-file
character) can render the plain text unseen by a particular method.

data do not expect a BOM. Where UTF-8 is used transparently in 8-bit environments, the use
of a BOM will interfere with any protocol or file format that expects specific ASCII characters at
the beginning, such as the use of "#!" of at the beginning of Unix shell scripts."
